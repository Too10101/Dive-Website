            <h1>Unconventional Diving</h1>
            <p>Redbull cliff diving is a type of diving that is sponsored by Redbull where the competitors jump of 27 meter diving platforms or cliffs. These platforms are a lot higher than anything seen in the olympics. Jumping off platforms that high makes Redbull cliff diving very dangerous. Everytime someone jumps there are always scuba divers in the water ready to save them just incase they make a mistake.</p>
